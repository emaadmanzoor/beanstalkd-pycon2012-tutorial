## Slides

We decided to build a terminal presentation, since we'd be spending most of
our time with code in the terminal. The was possible with the very awesome
[tkn](https://github.com/fxn/tkn) by [@fxn](https://github.com/fxn).

We'll upload a screencast or presentation of some form soon.

## Credits

We'd worked on this as a [course project](https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/distributed-pi-estimation)
under the guidance of Dr. Biju KR at BITS - Pilani, Goa Campus.
